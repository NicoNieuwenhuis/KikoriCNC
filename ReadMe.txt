These files comprise the part layouts for the Kikori 1.4 Open Source CNC Gantry Router.

'Kikori sheet 1' should be milled out of two 48" x 48" sheets of 3/4" MDO stacked on top of eachother.
All other layers should be milled to a depth of 1.6" to ensure that the cuts go all the way through both sheets.

'Kikori sheet 1 mirror insets' should be used to mill insets on the second of the large "L" shaped pieces that was on the bottom sheet of two milled using 'Kikori sheet 1'.  You should end up with two pieces with insets that are the mirror image of each other.

'Kikori sheet 2' should be milled out of one 48" x 48" sheet of 3/4" MDO.

Notes on DXF layers:
All layer names indicate what type of operation that layer requires:
Layers called 'profiles' should be milled on the outside of the line all the way through the material.
Layers called 'skin profiles should be milled to a depth of 0.7", leaving a 0.05" thick "skin" to be cut away manually with a knife.
Layers called 'slots' or 'slots + holes' should be milled on the inside of the line all the way through the material.
Layers called 'drill X"' should be drilled with the indicated drill diameter.
Layers containing the word 'pocket' should be pocketed to the indicated depth.
Layers containing the word 'inset' should be milled on the inside of the line to the indicated depth.
